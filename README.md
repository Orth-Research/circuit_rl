# Quantum Logic Gate Synthesis as a Markov Decision Process

### Abstract 
Reinforcement learning has witnessed recent applications to a variety of tasks in quantum programming. The underlying assumption is that those tasks could be modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Here, we investigate the feasibility of this assumption by exploring its consequences for two fundamental tasks in quantum programming: state preparation and gate compilation. By forming discrete MDPs, focusing exclusively on the single-qubit case (both with and without noise), we solve for the optimal policy exactly through policy iteration. We find optimal paths that correspond to the shortest possible sequence of gates to prepare a state, or compile a gate, up to some target accuracy. As an example, we find sequences of $H$ and $T$ gates with length as small as $11$ producing $\sim 99\%$ fidelity for states of the form $(HT)^{n} |0\rangle$ with values as large as $n=10^{10}$. In the presence of gate noise, we demonstrate how the optimal policy adapts to the effects of noisy gates in order to achieve a higher state fidelity. This work provides strong evidence that reinforcement learning can be used for optimal state preparation and gate compilation for larger qubit spaces.

### Description
This repository includes information, code, and data to generate the figures in the paper.

### Requirements
* scipy
* numpy
* pandas
* [pyquil](https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/index.html)

### Data Generation
The main files to perform the algorithm detailed in the paper are described below. Generated data can be found in the **results** folder. The following files were designed to be ran on a computing cluster, and they may need to be modified to run on other systems. 
* ```transitions.py``` Generates conditional probability distributions for a noiseless MDP. Can specify Bloch sphere discretization and available actions. 
* ```noisy_transitions.py``` Same as above, although we now allow for a noise channel to affect the transitions. 
* ```iteration.py``` Given a probability distribution and a goal state, runs policy iteration to find the optimal policy.
